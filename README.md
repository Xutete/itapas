A Python implementation of iTAPAS algorithm for static traffic assignment
=========================================

iTAPAS (improved traffic assignment by paired
alternative segments) algorithm [1,2] is an efficient algorithm for static traffic assignment especially in very large network. Here we provide a simple python implementation which can be readily used as a building block for research in transportation that requires static traffic assignment.

Requirement
-----------
Python 2.7 + NumPy
